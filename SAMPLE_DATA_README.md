## üîß Customization

### Adding More Data
To add more sample data, you can:

1. **Modify existing scripts**: Edit the data arrays in any script
2. **Create new scripts**: Follow the pattern of existing scripts
3. **Update the master script**: Add new scripts to the `scripts` array in `insert-all-sample-data.js`

### Database Schema
The scripts use the schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`. Make sure any new data follows the correct table structure.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Order Matters**: Scripts must be run in the correct order due to foreign key relationships
2. **Database Connection**: Ensure your database is running and accessible
3. **Existing Data**: Scripts will fail if data with the same IDs already exists
4. **Environment**: Make sure your environment variables (DATABASE_URL) are set correctly

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Error**: Check your database connection and environment variables
2. **Foreign Key Error**: Ensure scripts are run in the correct order
3. **Duplicate Key Error**: Clear existing data or use different IDs
4. **Schema Mismatch**: Verify the schema matches your database structure

### Resetting Data
To start fresh, you can:
1. Drop and recreate your database
2. Run migrations again
3. Run the sample data scripts

## üìù Data Relationships

The sample data includes realistic relationships:
- Each parking lot belongs to a supplier and airport
- Pricing is linked to parking lots with currency/region support
- Bookings reference users and parking lots
- Reviews are linked to users, lots, and bookings
- Supplier bookings manage the operational side

This provides a complete dataset for testing all application features including search, booking, reviews, and supplier management.
